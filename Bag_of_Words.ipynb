    "### Machine Learning: Bag-of-Words Model\n",
    "___\n",
    "#### Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bag-of-Words model takes in text and transforms it into a \"bag of words\" or more specifically, a vector of values where the values correspond to either the frequency of a word or the presence of a word. For this notebook we will be using the latter. So for example, given a dataset that consists of the following texts: \"Henry jumped down the well\" and \"The bus was late again\",  the words within the bag-of-words model would be: Henry, jumped, down, the, well, bus, was, late, again. The text \"Henry jumped down the well\" can then be represented by [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0] and a new text like \"Henry jumped the bus again\" can be represented by [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]. In this notebook we will also preprocess the text before applying the bag-of-words model. The different preprocessing techniques will depend on what kind of text is being preprocessed. Some of these techniques include stemming, lowercasing, and removing non-alphabetical symbols. Note that the Bag-of-Words model disregards word order and any spatial\n",
    "information and so it is expected to perform poorly on many text datasets.\n",
    "___\n",
    "#### This notebook will include:\n",
    "1. Preprocessing restaurant reviews\n",
    "2. Preprocessing emails\n",
    "3. Bag-of-Words model\n",
    "___\n",
    "#### Reference:\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of what is in this notebook was learned from the Machine Learning Coursera course by Andrew Ng and the Udemy course \"Machine Learning: A-Z\" by Kirill Eremenko."
